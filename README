This is code and data for my traffic correlation experiment.

To reproduce it yourself you'll need to edit sync-logs and score-logs to use your own machine's hostnames,
and you'll need to manually run log-tx-packets on each of your machines, including the one that is
hosting the hidden service.

Make sure you sync the clocks with ntpdate or similar before starting.

Modify fetch-site so that it fetches your hidden service instead of mine.

Then, with log-tx-packets logging data to a file on each machine (I assumed in ~/corr/log, modify sync-logs if that's not it),
leave fetch-site running.

Periodically check on your progress with "./sync-logs && ./score-logs".

Pretty ghetto, but demonstrates the concept.

Feel free to contact me at james@incoherency.co.uk if you want to talk about it any more.
